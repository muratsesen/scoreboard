# Live Football World Cup Scoreboard

I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to work on this task. Throughout the process, I have gained valuable insights into Test-Driven Development (TDD). Traditionally, I used to write tests after completing the implementation, but I now acknowledge that TDD is a superior approach. By writing tests first, I have achieved a more structured and robust development process, ensuring that my code is thoroughly tested and reliable. Embracing TDD has not only improved the quality of my work but has also boosted my confidence in the codebase. I look forward to applying these newfound skills in future projects and continuing to enhance my software development practices. Once again, thank you for this enriching experience.
